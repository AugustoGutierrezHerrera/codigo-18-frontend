            I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting
            opportunities. Has Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to focus
            on accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious about
            solving problems. Currently, I’m exploring Reactjs, Webflow and a
            bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy playing
            football, photography and playing Valorant. Learning more to improve
            skill.
